"""Meta-analysis ("Analyze"): cross-metric correlation/outlier synthesis over an agent's
evaluator scores.

Pure HTTP shaping — the async ClickHouse gather lives in `async_reader.agent_score_rows`, the
stats+LLM+persist in `MetaAnalysisService` (run in a threadpool, since it's sync), Postgres
lookups in `repositories`. The router never builds SQL.

The selector unit is the AGENT: pass `agent_id` (an events agent id) to scope, or "all"/blank for
the whole project. Analyses are persisted per (project, agent); the panel shows the latest on open
and re-runs on demand.
