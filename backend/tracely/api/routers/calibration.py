"""Judge-vs-human calibration: human labels on evaluator verdicts + per-evaluator agreement.

A reviewer agrees/disagrees with a judge's verdict on a target (trace / span / thread). Labels live
in Postgres (`score_annotations`, keyed by the score's natural identity + labeler); the evaluator
catalog and the labeling queue come from ClickHouse `scores`; the agreement math is pure
(`domain.evaluation.calibration`). The router shapes HTTP only — sync Postgres work runs in a
threadpool, ClickHouse reads are async, and no SQL is built here.
