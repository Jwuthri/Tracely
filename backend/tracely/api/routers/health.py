"""Health endpoint — a real readiness probe, not a static `ok`.

The read API can't serve a request without ClickHouse (traces/scores) and Postgres (registry), so
`/health` probes both and returns 503 when either is unreachable. The old static `{"status":"ok"}`
meant a backend with a dead DB pool reported healthy and kept taking traffic — the orchestrator
(docker/Railway healthcheck) could never route around it.
