"""Run a project's (or every project's) enabled monitors — the two halves of alerting.

**Polled** monitors (threshold over a window) are the beat's job: pull the window of samples from
ClickHouse, evaluate each condition (`domain.monitoring.conditions`), dispatch alerts to the
configured channels, and persist the monitor's `last_evaluated_at` / `last_fired_at` /
`last_fired_summary`.

Dedup: a monitor that just fired won't notify again until `min_interval_seconds` has passed
since `last_fired_at` (the engine still RE-evaluates, so `last_evaluated_at` updates every tick).

**Event** monitors are the pipeline's job: `notify_event` is called inline the moment the thing
happens (a CI gate finished FAIL, a conversation failed an evaluator, a new failure cluster
appeared) and notifies every enabled monitor whose condition matches. Sync, best-effort, and
deliberately NOT queued — an alert that arrives after the deploy is not an alert. The beat skips
event monitors (`is_event_condition`) so it never overwrites their state with a window it can't
evaluate.

Both halves share the channels, the `min_interval_seconds` dedup and the `last_fired_*` columns,
so the UI shows one list whichever way a monitor is triggered.

Async because every ClickHouse read in this codebase is async (via `async_reader`); the
Celery beat wrapper calls into `evaluate_all` via `asyncio.run`.
